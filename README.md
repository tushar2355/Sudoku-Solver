## Working:

-	Every time this Script is executed, a Random Solvable board is created.
-	Now, the user can first try to attempt solving it by clicking on the cells and entering values manually. Check the Input Section for the same.
-	Once the the user finalizes that the inputted number is the correct entry, pressing the enter key will attempt to input the number onto the board. 
-	Correct answers will be permanently displayed while incorrect answers will be removed. 
-	Likewise, values can be removed by pressing on the backspace or delete keys.

</p>

-	If at any point the player decides to solve the board, the Spacebar key can be pressed.
-	This will commence a visual which will demonstrate how the backtracking algorithm works and how it is being applied in order to solve the board.
